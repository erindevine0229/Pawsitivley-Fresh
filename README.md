# Description
An e-commerce site for pet food, supplies, and accessories. 

# Installation
Visit #### to view the store and purchase products for your pets.

To set up the project locally, first clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install both server and client dependencies by running 'npm install'. After installing the dependencies, create a .env file in the server directory with the necessary environment variables, including your MongoDB connection string (MONGODB_URI) and the port (PORT=3001). Optionally, you can seed the database by running npm run seed to populate the app with preloaded data. Finally, start the application using npm run develop, which will run both the server and client concurrently. Once the app is running, you can visit http://localhost:3000 to view the store and explore pet products.

# Usage
Once the application is running, users can visit the homepage to browse a variety of pet products, including both dog and cat food options. The site allows users to:

### Browse Products: 
View detailed descriptions of each product, including price, ingredients, and whether it's suitable for dogs or cats.
### Responsive Design: 
The website is fully responsive, making it accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
